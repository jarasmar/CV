I am an amateur coder growing into a competent and confident **Full Stack Junior Developer** while completing the intensive 12 weeks bootcamp of Makers Academy.

In a close future I'd be looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge and combine it with my creativity background.

## SKILLS

#### Adaptability
I have build a new life from scratch more times than I can count. I have lived in over ten different regions in five different countries. Each one of them with new people, new languages, new jobs. None of this is a problem, only the chance for an adventure.

#### Creative Problem Solving
Survivor of many kind of low-budget life projects I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving. If something seems imposible from the point you are looking at it, you just need to move and find a different point of view. Some years ago I decided to help a friend whose family bakery was struggling. It had a great location, but was too old-fashioned as the neighbourhood had passed from being very traditional to host mostly students. We had almost no money but I love refurbishing and upcycling. It ended up being a mix of bakery and coffee shop, keeping the traditional good recipes but with a fresh look and a lot of young new customers..

#### Attention to detail
From my background as a makeup, hair and costume artist for cinema I've learnt the importance of paying attention to detail. If you have ever dealt with *continuity* in filming you know how challenging can get to make a hair up-do look the exact same through scenes that may be filmed in different days. Look, look, look and then look again, just in case.

#### Organization
I love a plan, a list and a schedule. Even if I just make them for breaking them a minute later (life is unexpected and sometimes improvising is key). This is a skill I have also learned on set, where there is always a thousand things going on at the same time. Human memory has its limits: Do you remember if the extra actor was wearing a watch in the scene we started to shoot two weeks ago?  Make records of everything, file it properly and keep it organized. I can't tell how much I've fallen in love with git flow for this reason.

#### Languages
I am fluent in Spanish, English and Italian, with some basic understanding of French. I LOVE travelling, and had quite a lot of crazy anecdotes that would prove how I'm always willing to dive into a new language. For example, while spending two months hitch hiking through the countryside in Greece (where no one speaks English) I somehow managed to have the funniest conversations in 'Greek' with locals. I can also sing a Christmas carol in Finnish.

#### Team-player
Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.

#### Curiosity 
What? Why? How? If you talk to me about something I don't know, this is the reaction you should expect. As we say in my country *'el saber no ocupa lugar'* (knowledge does not take up space).

## VOLUNTEER WORK
From a very young age I have been interested in environmental and social issues. This has driven me to volunteer for different organizations, like the ones listed below. 

_Use the 'How I Contributed' dropdown menus to see all my responsabilities during my work with these organizations._

### Fundación Escuela de Solidaridad (2019)
This is a Foundation located in a small village near Granada, Spain. It gives home to over one hundred people living in social disadvantage, abuse or exclusion: mothers with children in emergency situations, young immigrants, adults and adolescents at risk. I spent a month living with them, and even if the conditions were sometimes a bit precarious, it was really inspiring seeing how everyone in the community was trying their best to improve.

<details>
  <summary>How I Contributed</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Responsible for directing the restoration project of one of the houses.</li>
    <li>Responsible for managing donations of second-hand clothing (storage, stock and distribution).</li>
    <li>Organized a Workshop on Sewing to produce merchandising for funding.</li>
    <li>Organized a Workshop on T-Shirt printing.</li>
    <li>Organized a Workshop on Natural Cosmetics Elaboration.</li>
  </ul>
</details> 

### Greenpeace (2008 to 2013)
I started volunteering for Greenpeace when I was only 15 years old. I am from a very small region in Spain and the day I got an email from them asking for volunteers to create a new regional group, I knew that was the place for me. Even for our small size we created a very active group, divided tasks amongst the members, and developed various activities such as public awareness campaigns, events organization, data research or signature campaigns.

<details>
  <summary>How I Contributed</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Internal mail distribution list management.</li>
    <li>Managed regional email account for information and demands from the public or other organizations.</li>
    <li>Create workshops and organize team rotas to participate in fairs.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

### Red Cross (2014)
It all started with a First Aid intensive course I did with them. They explained to us all their different departments of the organization and I decided to join them as a volunteer in what they call "mobile health care unit". This is a vehicle that travels through the city at night and tries to detect and address the basic socio-health needs of people on the street (homeless people, drug addicts, prostitutes, elderly people without resources...).

<details>
  <summary>How I Contributed</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitoring of people in vulnerable situations.</li>
    <li>Basic food and warm drinks distribution.</li>
    <li>Distribution of basic hygiene kits.</li>
    <li>Inform about the resources available in the city (organizations, shelters...).</li>
  </ul>
</details>

## INTERESTS
Where to find me when I am not coding:

<details>
  <summary><h3>Travelling:</h3></summary>
  <p>My one true passion in life. Finding me while I am might not be that easy though, I have a mysterious tendency to end up lost in the middle of nowhere in northern and rainy countries.</p>
  <p>Hint 1: Look for the drenched hitchhiker holding a camping tent and a backpack with a panda bear attached to it.</p>
  <p>Hint 2: Mountain hiking and Kayaking are probably going to be on my road map too.</p>
</details>
 
### Reading
Anything, anywhere. Preferably in the shade of a tree, but underground rush hour might as well do.

### City Culture
I grew up in a tiny village, and although I'm a nature lover that daily craves for forests and seaside, I am also amazed on how many things a city like London has to offer.

I often get lost in endless walks through the city, checking every detail in the architecture and the parks. Museums are my weak point here too, I normally forget time while inside, and only leave whith the closing announcement.

Want to know my last discovery? The Royal Opera House. I will never have enough of those dancers, singers and all the amazing costumes and scenarios.

### Upcycling
Clothes, furniture, a branch from a tree... Just give me a flea market, a sewing machine, few tools and some paint and I am set to play for hours.
