---------

I am an amateur coder growing into a competent and confident **Full Stack Junior Developer** while completing the intensive 12 weeks bootcamp of Makers Academy.

In a close future I'd be looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge and combine it with my creativity background.


## SKILLS

#### Adaptability
I have build a new life from scratch more times than I can count. I have lived in over ten different regions in five different countries. Each one of them with new people, new languages, new jobs. None of this is a problem, only the chance for an adventure. Let's start a new one.

#### Creativity
Trained in fine art and survivor of many kind of low-budget life projects I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving. If something seems imposible from the point you are looking at it, you just need to move and find a different point of view.

#### Curiosity 
What? Why? How? If you talk to me about something I don't know, this is the reaction you should expect. As we say in my country *'el saber no ocupa lugar'* (knowledge does not take up space).

#### Attention to detail
From my background as a makeup, hair and costume artist for cinema I've learnt the importance of paying attention to detail. If you have ever dealt with *continuity* in filming you know how challenging can get to make a hair updo look the exact same through scenes that may be filmed in different days. Look, look, look and then look again, just in case.

#### Organization
I love a plan, a list and a schedule. Even if I just make them for breaking them a minute later (life is unexpected and sometimes improvising is key). This is a skill I have also learned on set, where there is always a thousand things going on at the same time. Human memory has its limits: Do you remember if the extra actor was wearing a watch in the scene we started to shoot two weeks ago?  Make records of everything, file it properly and keep it organized. I can't tell how much I've fallen in love with git commits for this reason.

#### Team-player
Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.

#### Foreign Languages
Fluent in Spanish, English and Italian, with some basic understanding of French. Always willing to dive into a new language.

- Basic food and warm drinks distribution.
- Distribution of basic hygiene kits

## INTERESTS
Where to find me when I am not coding:
- Travelling, my one true passion in life. Finding me might not be that easy though, I have a mysterious tendency to end up lost in the middle of nowhere in northern and rainy countries. 
Hint: Look for the drenched hitchhiker with a camping tent and a backpack with a panda bear on it. 
Hint 2: Hiking and Kayaking are probably goint to be on my road map too.
- Reading, anything, anywhere. Preferably in the shade of a tree, but underground rush hour might as well do.
- Upcycling clothes, furniture, a branch from a tree... Just give me a flea market, a sewing machine, few tools and some paint and I am set to play for hours.
